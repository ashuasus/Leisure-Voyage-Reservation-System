# Leisure-Voyage-Reservation-System
The project's main goal is to computerize a company's data management. It takes the place of all paper work. It maintains and ensures that the computerized boat reservation system is implemented successfully 100 percent of the time. There are three modules in this reservation system. The first module assists the customer in determining the availability of seats on a specific boat. The second module assists him in confirming a ticket reservation. He can cancel a reserved ticket using the third module.

The first module gathers information from tables that are needed for the inquiry. On reservation, the second module enters values into the tables. On ticket cancellation, the third module deletes values from the table. Because the database is hosted on the internet using Oracle Server, the application can access data from anywhere in the world and by a large number of people at the same time.
